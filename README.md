Additional Work/Implementation that I would propose :

1. May be in terms of better locking mechanism I could have opted for Optimistic or Pessimistic Locking Mechanism.
2. I could have added Enity class and some in memory database for testing.
3. I could have implemented Swagger API documentation.
4. I could have implemented JWT token based Security for all teh Rest API endpoints.
5. I could have implemented Global Exception Handler.
6. I could have implemented some spring reactive way of implementation to make to non block IO.
